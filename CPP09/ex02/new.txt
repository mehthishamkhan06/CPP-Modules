🧩 Step 1 — What “recursive sorting” really means here

Recursion means:
👉 You apply the same algorithm again and again on smaller subsets of your data
until you’re down to something trivially sortable (like a list of 1 or 2 numbers).

In the Ford–Johnson algorithm:
1️⃣ You make pairs.
2️⃣ You extract winners (larger elements) → _main.
3️⃣ You extract losers (smaller elements) → _pend.
4️⃣ Then you recursively sort _main (using the same process).
5️⃣ Finally, you insert _pend back into the now-sorted _main.

So, recursion just means calling the same logic again on _main.

🧠 Step 2 — The recursive pattern

You can think of it like:

function fordJohnsonSort(container):
    if container.size() <= 1:
        return container

    // 1. Pair up elements
    // 2. Split into main (winners) and pending (losers)
    // 3. Recursively sort main
    // 4. Insert all from pending into sorted main using binary insertion
    // 5. Return main


So yes — the algorithm calls itself again on smaller subsets.

⚙️ Step 3 — What happens inside your function

Let’s say your _vector initially is:

[9, 3, 7, 2, 5]

🔹 Step 1: Pair up
(9,3), (7,2), leftover 5

🔹 Step 2: Split into groups
_main = [9,7]
_pend = [3,2,5]

🔹 Step 3: Recursively sort _main

You call the same logic again on [9,7]:

(9,7)
_main = [9]
_pend = [7]


Then recursively sort [9] → base case (already sorted).
Then insert 7 into [9] → [7,9].

So now you go back up:

_main (sorted) = [7,9]

_pend = [3,2,5]

🔹 Step 4: Insert _pend into _main

Insert them using binary search:

Insert 3 → [3,7,9]
Insert 2 → [2,3,7,9]
Insert 5 → [2,3,5,7,9]


Done ✅

🧮 Step 4 — Base case condition

Every recursion must know when to stop.

So:

if (container.size() <= 1)
    return; // already sorted


That’s your base case.

🧠 Step 5 — How to organize your code

You can implement a helper function like this (conceptually):

void PmergeMe::recursiveSort(std::vector<int>& arr) {
    if (arr.size() <= 1)
        return;

    // Step 1: Split into main/pending via pairing
    std::vector<int> main;
    std::vector<int> pending;

    for (size_t i = 0; i + 1 < arr.size(); i += 2) {
        int a = arr[i];
        int b = arr[i + 1];
        if (a > b) {
            main.push_back(a);
            pending.push_back(b);
        } else {
            main.push_back(b);
            pending.push_back(a);
        }
    }
    if (arr.size() % 2 != 0)
        pending.push_back(arr.back());

    // Step 2: Recursively sort main
    recursiveSort(main);

    // Step 3: Insert all pending into main (binary search)
    for (size_t i = 0; i < pending.size(); ++i)
        binaryInsert(main, pending[i]);

    // Step 4: Replace arr with sorted main
    arr = main;
}


That’s the core Ford–Johnson recursion structure — in human words:

“Pair, separate, sort the big ones, then slide the small ones back in.”

⚙️ Step 6 — Binary Insertion logic (preview)

binaryInsert(container, value) finds the correct position for value in container using binary search:

Compare with the middle element,

Move left/right accordingly,

Insert at the right index.

That ensures insertion is efficient and order-preserving.

You’ll need this helper for the recursive step.

🧭 Step 7 — Summary of recursion flow
Step	Action	Description
1	Check base case	Stop if size ≤ 1
2	Make pairs	Split into main (larger) and pending (smaller)
3	Recurse	Sort main again using same algorithm
4	Insert	Insert all pending (and leftover) into sorted main
5	Return	Replace current container with sorted result
💡 Step 8 — When to bring in Jacobsthal

You’ll later modify Step 4 (Insert) to follow Jacobsthal order, but for now just insert linearly.

Once your recursion works correctly and produces sorted output, you can replace:

for (size_t i = 0; i < pending.size(); ++i)
    binaryInsert(main, pending[i]);


with the Jacobsthal-controlled order.
